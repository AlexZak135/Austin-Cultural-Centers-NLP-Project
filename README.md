# Austin-Cultural-Centers-NLP-Project

## Background

Cultural centers are vital across the United States, serving as hubs for diverse groups to celebrate their heritage through various activities. As a melting pot of cultures, the U.S. relies on these centers to preserve traditions and educate younger generations about their family histories. Additionally, these centers allow individuals to explore cultures outside their own, enriching the understanding of the diverse cultural landscape.

Acknowledging their importance, the city of Austin, Texas, conducted a community survey in January 2020 targeting its cultural centers to assess facilities, staff, fees, and programs. The survey focused on institutions such as the African American Cultural and Heritage Facility, the Asian American Resource Center, the Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center, and the George Washington Carver Museum. The feedback from a significant number of Austin residents highlighted strengths and areas for improvement.

## Research Focus and Methodology

The aim of this research was to analyze qualitative, unstructured text from open-ended responses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. These included term frequency analysis, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), sentiment analysis with lexicon-based methods, and topic modeling via unsupervised machine learning. While the survey included quantitative questions, such as Likert scale items, these often miss the nuanced insights from open-ended responses. By leveraging a variety of NLP methods, the research uncovered significant insights not accessible through quantitative data alone, highlighting the value of NLP in analyzing open-ended questions. The research sought to evaluate the effectiveness of cultural centers, identifying areas for improvement, and comparing centers across various areas.

## Results

The research provided valuable insights, revealing both positive attributes and potential areas for improvement within cultural centers. Term frequency analysis highlighted strengths such as welcoming staff and affordable programs, alongside weaknesses like limited parking at specific centers like the Asian American Resource Center and Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center. TF-IDF scores displayed significant terms unique to certain centers, offering insights into the availability of affordable services and positive leadership feedback at certain centers.

Sentiment analysis predominantly captured positive feedback, with high praise for program offerings, though it pointed out concerns regarding cleanliness. This method facilitated detailed comparisons, notably positioning the George Washington Carver Museum as frequently receiving the most favorable feedback. Topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation revealed key themes ranging from cultural cuisine to theater productions, with document-topic probabilities highlighting the most pertinent topics for each center. These NLP techniques effectively identified what is working well and areas needing enhancement, aiming to improve Austin residents' experience at these cultural centers.
